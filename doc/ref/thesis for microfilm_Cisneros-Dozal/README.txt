    Hi Jeff,

    I enclose the PDF file of my PhD dissertation, I think chapter 3 might have some of the information you want.

    I also found some files with data on the incubations I did, which samples from Oak Ridge did you incubate?
    If you let me know sites, plots, etc. I can try to find those data, hopefully!

    I did manipulated incubations (two different temperatures and moisture levels) for the Walker Branch site only. Then I think I did other incubations at field moisture and room temperature.

    I hope this is helpful, let me know which data you are after.

    I will be interested in seeing what comes out of your experiments and your future papers!

    Best regards,

    Malu
