    Hi Jeff,



    Thanks for sending the file, there are a lot of plots in there!



    You are in luck as I found the file for the data on incubations of samples collected in August 2004. The file contains more information that you probably need (or want!), but hopefully some answers to your questions too. There are 4 spreadsheets and I am sure you can figure it all out, the first one has a note on the room temperature for most days, I am afraid that would be the only information I have on incubation temperature. There is also information on gravimetric water content (2nd spreadsheet). Information on litter samples are in there too, who knows maybe you can get a hold of the old litter samples too? ðŸ˜Š



    I have not deleted anything on the file or modified anything, I am sending the file as I found it so whatever you see in blank, it was like that when I found the file!



    Also, there is an abbreviation there in the last spreadsheet, column L that I cannot remember what it means (!!) but it is probably irrelevant for the information you need.



    Calculations should be self-explanatory but by all means feel free to ask me questions if something is unclear (or obscure!) and I will do my best to remember what I did ðŸ˜Š



    The one piece of information I am not sure I have is C contentâ€¦.



    Let me know how you do with these data. One last thing, the manipulated incubations were done on samples collected in 2003 I believe, and yes, there was about a week of monitoring of the rates of fluxes, then the jars were vented and CO2 let to accumulate for collection of a sample for 14C measurement. I think there was a normalisation of the fluxes measured under altered temperature and moisture using the first week of measurements, which were done before changing temperature and moisture. But again, those were for 2003 samples, and yes, as stated in my thesis, I think, the %moisture was altered to 20% by volume on soil core samples.



    Glad to help further and provide more data if you need it, just let me know and keep me posted on your results!



    Enjoy the Easter break with some data to look at ðŸ˜Š
