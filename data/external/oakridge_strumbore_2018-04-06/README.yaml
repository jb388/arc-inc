  - email from Sue accompanying data:
    Dear Jeff,

    Here are spreadsheets with the original data for the samples.  SOrry if they are a bit of a mess….

    Boreas samples - see the summary page, with light green cells for the summary for these samples.
    Cowlitz incubations - self explanatory
    Incubations-McFarlane - has the data from the Bartlett and Harvard forest sites.
    Duke_priming is the short term incubation - samples in green capped plastic
    Chronic N OM - has organic matter and incubation CO2 for some more of the samples (NWN in green caps)
    Oak Ridge summary — here is what the sample code means:  (eg TVA 2B C)
             Two sites WB= Walker Branch; TVA = Tennessee Valley Authority
             the number is the plot number;  B= background litter added (+250 per mil);  E= Elevated 14C litter added  (+1000 per mil)
             L = Litter,  C= core (0-5 cm mineral soil)

    Let me know if you have questions…..

    Sue
