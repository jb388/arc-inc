Contents:
  - CO2 measurements, jar information, measurement schedule, and soil and moisture data for first round of archived incubation experiment
Notes:
  - various samples, CO2 data for incubations conducted in 2018 on soils following air-drying and storage
  - also contains copies of 13C and 14C data, but subsequent analysis draws from raw iso lab data files
  - samples analyzed:
    - set 1:
      - MA-1
      - MA-2
      - MA-3
      - MB-1

      - MB-3
      - SA-1
      - SA-2
      - SA-3
      - SB-1
      - SB-2
      - SB-3
      - Du123-1
      - Du120-1
      - TVA 4E C-1

    - set 2:

      - HEG6-1
      - HEG6-2
      - HEG6-3
      - HEW49-1
  - final numeral in ID is lab replicate; n reps determined by mass of available sample
  - most (maybe all?) data in file "ArcInc_IncData_2018.xlsx" is duplicated here
  - 27-Apr-2020:
    - added cols N:Q on sheet 'Jar_information' to recalculate incubation start dates
    - all start date references on subsequent CO2 measurement sheets were then changed from col M to col Q
    - two summary sheets were also added, one for the first set of samples ('arc-tme-flux-t2-1') and one for the second set ('arc-tme-flux-t2-2')
