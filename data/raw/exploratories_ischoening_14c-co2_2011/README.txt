Notes:
  - Not exactly sure where this file came from. The naming convention suggests it is from BExIS, the data repository maintained by FSU Jena for the Biodiversity Exploratories project <https://www.bexis.uni-jena.de>
  - However, this is the raw file as I received it, and from the naming convention I assume is is a non-public BExIS file
