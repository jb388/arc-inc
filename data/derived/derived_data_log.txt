  - created a summary file "OakRidge_CO2_fluxes_summary_2020-04-09.xlsx" for Oak Ridge CO2 flux data
  - copied each set of CO2 concentrations from 'CO2_FLUXES' sheet of "Incubations_August_2004_samples.xlsx" onto sheet 'timeSeries' of new file
  - calculated mass of CO2 from LiCor data in raw file using PV=nRT
  - dry soil mass data on sheet 'finalData' of new file came from "Incubations_August_2004_samples.xlsx" cell refs 'SUMMARY_ALL_DATA!H30:H31'

  - renamed summary file "OakRidge_CO2_fluxes_summary_2020-04-09.xlsx" to "co2Flux_ornl_sum_2020-04-13.xlsx" using new convention: dataType_source_category_YYYY-MM-DD
  - updated 'meta' sheet with dry soil mass source
  - may want to change absolute values to links to preserve sources of copied data, but then again, I really dislike Excel files with links to external files, so maybe not...
