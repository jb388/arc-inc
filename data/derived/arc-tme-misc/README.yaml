Contents:
  - fluxes and isotope (13C, 14C) data for treatment incubations of miscellaneous samples incubated by S. Trumbore and C. Lawrence
Notes:
  - arc-tme-sierra.xlsx:
    - incubation fluxes, soil mass and moisture data, and isotope data from data/external/trumbore_misc_2020-03-27/Sues_archiveInc_data.xls
    - "NWN" samples are from the N enrichment experiment at Harvard Forest (MA, USA)
    - "How" samples are from Howland Experimental Forest (ME, USA)
    - "TVA" and "WB" samples are from Oak Ridge National Laboratory (TN, USA)
    - rows 15:19 on sheet 'Sheet 1_copy' are samples incubated by C. Lawrence; remaining samples incubated by S. Trumbore
    - unclear how the concentrations are calculated (slopes and intercepts from std curve data do not match the values used in the formulae), so currently not reading in the flux data
